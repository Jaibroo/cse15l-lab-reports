## Step 1: Logging into ieng6

For this step I did the following keypresses: `<up><up><enter>` The `ssh cs15lsp23qb@ieng6.ucsd.edu` was up two in the command history, so the arrows allowed me to access it quicker. Then I did: `<t><o><j><i><enter>` to login into my remote account using my key-phrase rather than usual passwords.

## Step 2: Cloning fork of Repository 

There are two ways to get this step done.

1. Using the terminal:

Here I went into the github repository to copy the link "https://github.com/Jaibroo/lab7.git" `<Ctrl-C>` and then paste along with `<g><i><t><space><c><l><o><n><e><Ctrl-V><enter>` which would ultimately clone the code into the current terminal and work onto the correct path.

2. Using the command-line:

Here I copied the link from the github repository `<Ctrl-C>` and went on to the clone repository option on VsCode and `<Ctrl-V><enter>` to sucessfully copy over the code and be able to see and edit the code much easier and to have a clone of it.
